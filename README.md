# OmiVAE
Integrated Multi-omics Analysis Using Variational Autoencoders. An end-to-end deep learning model for low dimensional latent space extraction and multi-class classification on multi-omics datasets. This is modified architecture of the original paper. Instead of using mathylation data zith chromosome listing, I change the architecture to take into account only one entry like expression data.
